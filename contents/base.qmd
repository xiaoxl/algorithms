## comparision based search

has a lower bound $\Omega(n\log n)$: tree argument

- Each internal node in the tree represents a comparison between two elements.
- Each leaf represents a possible final outcome (e.g., the index of the median).
- The height of this tree represents the worst-case number of comparisons (which is time complexity).

n elements, the algorithm needs to be able to distinguish all possible arrangements of the data
the number is n!
so there has to be n! leaves
then the height h should be $2^h\geq n!$

Stirling: $n!\sim \sqrt{2\pi n}n^n/\me^n$
so $h=\Omega(\log n)$

## comparision based sort
it is $\Omega(n\log n)$


## not comparision based sort
e.g. counting sort

$O(n+M)$ and it is $O(n)$ if $M=O(n)$
