# Linear Programming

## max-flow

input: directed G with c LP: m variables: fe for every e obj function: max sum fsv constraints: 0\<=fe\<=ce, and inflow=outflow

obj and constraints are all linear, so it is linear programming

feasible region feasible region is convex

## simple LP

all inequality has to be strict

if x is unconstrained

we could add x+ and x- two variables

maximize C\^TX constriant: AX\<=b X\>=0

n variables, n+m constriants

feasible region: intersection of n+m half spaces=convex plyhedron

vertices=n constraints with =, m constraint with \<=

vertices: worst case: C\^n\_{n+m}

each vertex has at most nm neibors

simplex:

start at x=0 look for neighboring vertex with higher objective value, and move there and repeat if no found, it is the global maximal

feasible problem is a LP problem

## dual

n var, m constraints max CTx, Ax\<=b, x\>=0

dual m var, n constraints min bTy, ATy\>=c, y\>=0

primal: max cTx, Ax\<=b, x\>=0

dual min bTy, ATy\>=c, y\>=0

-\> max -bTy, -ATy\<=-c, y\>=0

dual of dual

# min -cTz, -Az\>=-b, z\>=0

max CTz, Az\<=b, z\>=0

dual of dual is equivalent to the primal

::: {#thm-}
## Weak duality Theorem

Feasible x for primal LP, Feasible y for dual LP

CTx\<=bTy
:::

::: {#cor-}
corollory: if x, y such that CTX=BTy, then x and y are optimal
:::

<div>

if primal is unbounded, the dual is infeasible.

if dual is unbounded, then primal is infeasible.

</div>

if dual LP is infeasible, then primal is unbounded, or infeasible if dual and primal are both feasible: then primal is unbounded.

feasible:

1.  add z
2.  maximize z such that Ax+z\<=b to see if it is \>0

primal is feasible:\>dual is either unbounded or infeasible

if dual is feasible, it has to be unbounded.

<div>

## Strong duality theorem

Thm:

primal LP is feasible and bounded iff dual is feasible and bounded

primal has optimal x\* iff dual has optimal y\*

</div>

max-flow=min st-cut

## Linear programming

### Standard form (Cannonical form)

-   primal
    -   $\max c^Tx$
    -   $Ax\leq b$, $x\geq 0$
-   dual
    -   $\min b^Ty$
    -   $A^Ty\geq c$, $y\geq 0$.

| **primal**  | **dual**     |
|-------------|--------------|
| $\max c^Tx$ | $\min b^Ty$  |
| $Ax\leq b$  | $A^Ty\geq c$ |
| $x\geq 0$   | $y\geq 0$    |

### Duality

### boundedness and feasibility

1. feasibility is first
2. dual is an upper limit to the primal. so dual feasible=primal bounded
3. unboundedness -> dual infeasibility

1. inf, f&u, f&b
2. inf->inf, or f&u
3. f&u->inf
4. f&b->f*b

inf <-> inf
inf <-> f&u
f&b <-> f&b



### Duality theorem

cor: if x and y cx=by, then both are optimal
cor2: f&u->inf


### Checking feasible

feasibility is only related to the constraints

add a z to the constraints
question: can z be positive

LP: max z
Ax+z<=b, x>=0

this is feasible

Q: whether z is positive







### checking unbounded

Primal is feasible, 

- dual is infeasible: primal is f&u
- dual is feasible: primal is f&b
- 



max-flow dual is min st-cut
