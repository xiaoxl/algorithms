# DFS



Depth-First Search (DFS)
Topological Sort
Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

    - first dfs to get topological ordering
    - apply cc based on the ordering

## DAG

A directed graph has a cycle iff its dfs reveals a back edge.

Every DAG has at least one source and one sink.

In a DAG every edge leads to a lower post number vertex.



pre number is the order when the vertex is discovered.
post number is the order when the vertex is done exploring.



Highest post number is in a source scc.
