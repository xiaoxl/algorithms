# MST


Greedy: take locally optimal move

when does that lead to global optimum?

knapsack: doesn't work (greedy doesn't lead to global: has to consider all earlier setting instead of just the best one)
mst: cut property and it would work




## Tree

Tree = connected acyclic graph

1. n-vertices Tree has n-1 edges. If more than n-1 edges, there is at least one cycle.
2. in a tree, exactly one path between every pair of vertices. (ow either cycle or not connected)
3. Any connected G with n-1 edges is a tree.



Definition

::: {#def-}
## MST

- Given: undirected G with weights
- Goal: find minimal size, connected subgraph (spanning tree) of min weights

find min weight spanning tree of G

:::

## Greedy
Keep adding smaller weight edges which doesn't create cycles.


Kruskal's algorithm

1. Sort E by increasing weight
2. Set X=empty
3. For edge in E:
   1. if X+e doesn't create cycles: X=X+e
4. Return X

Sort: O(m log n) time
check cycles: in the subgraph (V, X) where we consider all nodes but only edges in X.
    - let c(v)=all points connecting to v in X
    - let c(w)=all points connecting to w in X
    - if c(v) != c(w) then add e to X
  - Use union-Find data strcutre O(log n)

Greedy works: can add a edge one at a time. 

add an edge that connect different connected components of X

## Exercise


Practice Problems

### [DPV] Problem 4.14 (Shortest path through a given vertex)

### [DPV] Problems 5.1, 5.2 (Practice fundamentals of MST designs)

### [DPV] Problem 5.9 (multiple statements about MST. We will provide the answer to a few, you are welcome to try them all)

### Graded Problem

You are given an undirected, weighted, connected graph $G=(V, E)$, and an MST $T$ of $G$. The weight of an edge $e$, which is part of $T$, is doubled. All other edges keep their original weight.

Design an algorithm that outputs an MST for the graph $G$ with the new weights. Note that your new MST does not have to be distinct from $T$.

Building an MST from scratch will receive little credit!
