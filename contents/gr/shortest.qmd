# Shortest paths






![](assests/img/20250219170815.png)

Fix s. Define a function dist(z)=length of the shortest path from s to z

## Dijkstra: given G and s, finds dist(z) for all v.
Run BFS with weights. Take advantage of priority array. Dijkstra requires positive weights: since once a shortest path is computed, it won't compute it again. Which is not the case if there is negative path. [If all weights are positive, then we will through every edge at most once.]

### New problem:Given G with w. find a negative weight cycle.

## Bellman-Ford algorithm



Bellman-Ford(G, s, w)

``` pseudocode
#| html-indent-size: "1.2em"
#| html-comment-delimiter: "//"
#| html-line-number: true
#| html-line-number-punc: ":"
#| html-no-end: false
#| pdf-placement: "htb!"
#| pdf-line-number: true

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Bellman-Ford}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Bellman-Ford}{G,s,w}
    \For {$z\in V$}
        \State $D(0,z)=\infty$, $D(0, s)=0$.
    \EndFor
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

To get all graphs into z: look at the reverse graph(this is O(n+m)) find all going out


Use BF algorithm we can find the dist function.

check if D is decreasing.


Bellman-Ford: O(mn)



## Floyd-Warshall algorithm

for all pairs

If we directly run BF for all vertices, the runtime is O(n^2m). Note that m is up to n^2, so unless the graph is very sparse, the runtime is around O(n^4).

Floyd-Warshall O(n^3)

D(i, s, t)=length of shortest path s->t using a subset of the first i vertices as intermediate vertices.

if i is on the path, D(i,s,t)=D(i-1, s, i)+D(i-1, i, t)
if i is not on the path, D(i,s,t)=D(i-1,s,t)


Assuming NO negative weight cycles




## how to detect negative weight cycles

FW: diagonal is negative

BF: also can do


negative wt cycles
